Data Science Portfolio by Peter Salamon
======

This portfolio is a collection of data analysis and machine learning projects I have created in an effort to hone my skills as a data sceintist and machine learning engineer. Projects are divided into 3 broad categories below. It is recommended that guests view the projects in Jupyter nbviewer; links are provided below each project title.

Data Processing and Exlporation

### College Scorecard Analysis

View this project on [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/College_Scorecard_Analysis/College%20Scorecard%20Analysis.ipynb) or [GitHub](https://github.com/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/College_Scorecard_Analysis/College%20Scorecard%20Analysis.ipynb)

This project involves the analysis of colleges across all 50 states between the years 2006 and 2016. The analysis focuses on the financial status and employment status of students after graduation, as well as the distribution of degree types, based on geography.

### National Youth Tobacco Survey Analysis

This project involves the analysis of responses to the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) distributed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The analysis focuses on the rate of smoking amongst young adults in the United States and seeks to uncover whether or not the introduction of electronic cigarettes has really sparked a health crisis among the youth of our nation.

### Analysis of Pharmaceutical Product Reviews

This project involves the analysis of raw text data in the form of reviews, written by users of www.drugs.com. The analysis focuses on exploring various characteristics of the brand names of the medications as well as the reviews of the drugs themselves. The main goals of the analysis involve finding ways in which drug manufacturers may improve upon the production quality and marketing of the medications they produce.



Machine Learning Projects

### Superconductor Critical Temperature Regression

View this project on [Jupyter nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Superconductivity_Regression/Superconductivity%20Regression.ipynb) or [GitHub](https://github.com/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Superconductivity_Regression/Superconductivity%20Regression.ipynb)

This project involves the prediction of the critical temperature for various, potential, superconducting compounds using a Random Forest Regression model. The critical temperature for materials is nutoriously difficult to predict. The model created here may aid researchers in the inference of critical temperatures based on a compound's chemical structure and characteristics.

### Autism Spectrum Disorder Classification

View this project on [Jupyter nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Autism_Classification/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder%20Classification.ipynb) or [GitHub](https://github.com/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Autism_Classification/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder%20Classification.ipynb)

In this project, a predictive classification model is built with the goal of predicting whether or not a child will be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The process for diagnosing ASD is, currently, lengthy as well as costly. A statistical model may relieve some of the shortcomings of the current process making it more efficient and easier to implement.
