Data Science Portfolio by Peter Salamon
======

This portfolio is a collection of data analysis and machine learning projects I have created in an effort to hone my skills as a data scientist and machine learning engineer. Projects are divided into 3 broad categories below. It is recommended that guests view the projects in Jupyter nbviewer if given the choice; links are provided below each project title.

View this project on [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Pharmaceutical_Reviews_NLP/Analysis%20of%20Pharmaceutical%20Product%20Reviews.ipynb) or [GitHub](https://github.com/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Pharmaceutical_Reviews_NLP/Analysis%20of%20Pharmaceutical%20Product%20Reviews.ipynb)

This project involves the analysis of raw text data in the form of reviews, written by users of www.drugs.com. The analysis focuses on exploring various characteristics of the brand names of the medications as well as the reviews of the drugs themselves. The main goals of the analysis involve finding ways in which drug manufacturers may improve upon the production quality and marketing of the medications they produce.



Machine Learning Projects
-------

### Superconductor Critical Temperature Regression

View this project on [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Superconductivity_Regression_Thesis/Superconductivity%20Regression.ipynb)

This project involves the prediction of the critical temperature for various, potential, superconducting compounds using a Random Forest Regression model. The critical temperature for materials is nutoriously difficult to predict. The model created here may aid researchers in the inference of critical temperatures based on a compound's chemical structure and characteristics.

### Start-Up Company Business Analysis

View this project on [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/Peters64s/424391)

Investors often rely on intuition and past experience in order to judge whether a start-up company will be worth investing in. This project aims to put forth a rigorous analysis that can be used to identify relevant factors indicative of a successful start-up company. In addition, a machine learning model is created to predict whether or not a company is likely to succeed based on an array of company characteristics and economic measures.

### Autism Spectrum Disorder Classification

View this project on [Jupyter nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Autism_Classification/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder%20Classification.ipynb) or [GitHub](https://github.com/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Autism_Classification/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder%20Classification.ipynb)

In this project, a predictive classification model is built with the goal of predicting whether or not a child will be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The process for diagnosing ASD is, currently, lengthy as well as costly. A statistical model may relieve some of the shortcomings of the current process making it more efficient and easier to implement.

### Bank Marketing Data Analysis & Classification Using Random Forests

View this project on [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/Peters64s/451160)

Bank marketing data, collected my a Portuguese banking institution, is used to build a predictive model to determine which clients are likely to purchase a subscription to the bank using demographic information collected during marketing campaigns.

### Natural Language Processing of Amazon Instant Video Data

View this project on [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/Peters64s/453779)

In this analysis, Parts-of-Speech Tagging and sentiment analysis using a Logistic Regression classification model are performed on Amazon Instant Video data in an effort to determine if marketing of the Amazon Instant Video service can be further improved leading to an increase in revenue.        

### Cancer Gene Expression Clustering

View this project on [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Gene_Expression_Clustering/Cancerous%20Gene%20Expression%20Clustering.ipynb) or [GitHub](https://github.com/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Gene_Expression_Clustering/Cancerous%20Gene%20Expression%20Clustering.ipynb)

In this project, a clustering analysis is performed on the gene expression data of over 20,000 genes and across five different types of cancers. In addition, a classification model is built with the goal of predicting the type of cancer present in a patient based on patterns in the expression of their genes. Advances in biology and medicine seem to stagnate as a result of overwhelming amounts of data needing to be analyzed. Machine learning can be implemented to compress this data down to smaller and more meaningful portions of information. 

### Customer Segmentation of an E-Commerce Website

View this project on [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Customer_Segmentation/customer_segmentation.ipynb)

In this project, the customers of a UK-based e-commerce retailer are clustered into groups based on their shopping behaviors and a Logistic Regression model is created to classify new customers based on their purchase history using data consisting of over 500,000 user transactions over the span of 2 years.

This project explores the inner workings of Artificial Neural Networks. A simple neural network model is built from scratch and with the Keras package as well. Finally, it is turned into a classification agent for the recognition of hand written digits using the famed MNIST dataset. 

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

View this project on [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Neural_Networks/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20%28CNN%29.ipynb) or [GitHub](https://github.com/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Neural_Networks/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20(CNN).ipynb)

This project probes the inner workings of Convolutional Neural Networks. How CNNs are structured and how they function is first discussed followed by the creation of two simple CNNS. The first model attempts to classify images of dogs and cats while the other distinguishes between three different types of tumors using brain MRI scans.


### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

View this project on [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Neural_Networks/Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks%20%28RNN%29.ipynb) or [GitHub](https://github.com/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Neural_Networks/Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks%20(RNN).ipynb)

This post uncovers the secrets of the Recurrent Neural Network. The structure and functions of the model are initially discussed folowed by a working example of an RNN in action. The goal of the RNN that is built is to predict the 'future' open prices of Google's stock, for January of 2017, using the daily open price, close price, high, low, and volume of the stock between the years of 2012 and 2017.
