Data Science Portfolio by Peter Salamon
======

This portfolio is a collection of data analysis and machine learning projects I have created in an effort to hone my skills as a data sceintist and machine learning engineer. Projects are divided into 3 broad categories below.

Data Processing and Exlporation
------

### College Scorecard Analysis

View this project on [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/College_Scorecard_Analysis/College%20Scorecard%20Analysis.ipynb) or [GitHub](https://github.com/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/College_Scorecard_Analysis/College%20Scorecard%20Analysis.ipynb)

This project involves the analysis of colleges across all 50 states between the years 2006 and 2016. The analysis focuses on the financial status and employment status of students after graduation, as well as the distribution of degree types, based on geography.



Machine Learning Projects

### Superconductor Critical Temperature Regression

View this project on [Jupyter nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Superconductivity_Regression/Superconductivity%20Regression.ipynb) or [GitHub](https://github.com/petersalmon/petersalmon.github.io/blob/master/Superconductivity_Regression/Superconductivity%20Regression.ipynb)

This project involves the prediction of the critical temperature for various, potential, superconducting compounds using a Random Forest Regression model. The critical temperature for materials is nutoriously difficult to predict. The model created here may aid researchers in the inference of critical temperatures based on a compound's chemical structure and characteristics.
